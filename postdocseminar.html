	<p> Below is the list of talks, speakers, and topics: </p>

	<ul>
  		<li><b>September 12:</b> Introduction/overview - Alekos Robotis. A brief overview of the ideas and concepts introduced in [KKPY].  </li>
  		<li><b>September 19:</b> Gromov-Witten Invariants - Peter Moody. This talk covers the main definitions and first results about genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants. Reference: [FP]  </li>
  		<li><b>September 26:</b> Quantum Cohomology - This talk introduces the structures of quantum cohomology constructed using Gromov-Witten theory and their relations to the A-model F-bundle introduced in [KKPY]. </li>
		<li><b>October 3:</b> F-bundles - This talk covers 1) the basic language of non-Archimedean geometry needed to formulate the results on F-bundles and 2) the definitions of first properties of F-bundles from section 2 of [HYZZ]. References: [A] and [HYZZ]   </li>
		<li><b>October 10:</b> Decomposition Theorems for F-manifolds - This talk covers 1) the Frobenius theorem in non-Archimedean and formal geometry and 2) decomposition theorems for F-manifolds. References: [HYZZ] sections 3.1 and 3.2. </li>
		<li><b>October 17:</b> Decompositions of Maximal F-bundles - This talk covers the spectral decomposition theorem for maximal F-bundles. </li>
		<li><b>October 24:</b> Iritani's Blowup Formula - This talk gives an overview of the recent work of Iritani on the blowup formula in the language of quantum D-modules. Reference: [I] </li>
		<li><b>October 31:</b> KKPY Blowup Formula - This talk explains the proof of the blowup formula of [KKPY] (i.e. Theorem 4.5) and mentions the similar result for projective bundles. Time permitting, section 5.4 of [HYZZ] could also be discussed. </li>
		<li><b>November 7:</b> Hodge Atoms - This talk introduces the notion of Hodge Atoms, used in the construction of new birational invariants using the theory of F-bundles. Reference: [KKPY] section 5. </li>
		<li><b>November 14:</b> Cubic Fourfolds - This talk explains the applications of the theory of Hodge Atoms to proving irrationality of very general cubic fourfolds. Reference: [KKPY] sections 6.1 and 6.2. </li>
		<li><b>November 21</b>: More examples - This talk discusses further examples of Hodge Atoms of projective varieties. Reference: [KKPY] section 6. </li>
		<li><b>December 5:</b> Bonus Talk - TBD! </li>

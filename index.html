	<p> I am a sixth year graduate student at Cornell University working under the supervision of <a href="https://math.cornell.edu/daniel-halpern-leistner">Daniel Halpern-Leistner.</a> I am interested in derived and triangulated categories and moduli spaces in algebraic geometry. In spring 2024 I was a Stephen Della Pietra Fellow at MSRI/SLMath in Berkeley, California affiliated with the research semester in noncommutative algebraic geometry. This semester (fall 2024) I will be on the job market for postdoctoral positions. You can find a copy of my CV <a href ="CV.pdf">here</a>. </p>

	<p> Together with Jeffrey Jiang, I co-founded the <a href ="https://sites.google.com/cornell.edu/cornell-drp">Cornell DRP</a> in Spring of 2020. I am currently a co-organizer of the DRP, together with Chase Vogeli and Sara Venkatraman. </p>
	<p> I also sometimes answer questions on <a href ="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/252284/alekos-robotis">math stack exchange.</a> </p>
	<p> You can get in contact with me by email at ar2377"at"cor.....edu. </p>

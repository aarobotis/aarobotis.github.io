	<h1> Alekos Robotis </h1>
	<p> This fall, I will be an NSF postdoctoral fellow in the department of mathematics of Columbia University. I recently completed my PhD at Cornell University working under the supervision of <a href="https://math.cornell.edu/daniel-halpern-leistner">Daniel Halpern-Leistner.</a> I am interested in derived and triangulated categories and moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, with a particular emphasis on Bridgeland stability conditions. In the spring of 2024 I was a Stephen Della Pietra Fellow at MSRI/SLMath in Berkeley, California affiliated with the research semester in noncommutative algebraic geometry. </p>

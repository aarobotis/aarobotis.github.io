	<h1> Alekos Robotis </h1>
	<p> I am an NSF postdoctoral fellow at Columbia University interested in derived and triangulated categories and moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, with a particular emphasis on Bridgeland stability conditions. I recently completed my PhD at Cornell University working under the supervision of <a href="https://math.cornell.edu/daniel-halpern-leistner">Daniel Halpern-Leistner.</a> This fall, I am co-organizing the <a href ="postdocseminar.html">postdoc algebraic geometry seminar</a>  </p>
